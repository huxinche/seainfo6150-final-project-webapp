      The health and safety of the Boston University community is our top priority. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, we drew on our deep research expertise and state-of-the-art facilities to establish an in-house testing, tracing, and screening program. By running our own collection sites and laboratories, we are able to test students, faculty and staff frequently, return results within 24 hours, and respond as necessary with minimal disruption to academic and campus life.
